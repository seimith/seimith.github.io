This tutorial is about spinning UIViews. Why spinning things you might ask? Animations can be (for a lack of better terminology because I hate this word) delightful for users.

Anywho, you might just need to animate a loading spinner thing or something for you app.

In this case, I've just created a few UIViews and added animation to it. If you want, you can even just use a UIImage component and spin that instead.
