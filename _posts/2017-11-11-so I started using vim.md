So I recently started using VIM and now I can't stop typing `:q` whenever I want to close random browser windows.

Here are the VIM plugins I've been using:

[VIM Plug][VIM PLUG] - for adding VIM plugins

[VIM PLUG]: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

[Nerd Tree][NERD TREE] - VIM tree view

[NERD TREE]: https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree

[Nerd Tree Git][NERD TREE GIT] - git plugin to view git status in tree view

[NERD TREE GIT]: https://github.com/Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin

[Emmet][EMMET] - for fast HTML & CSS

[EMMET]: https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim/

And some basic VIM commands that I think everybody needs to know! :-)

`:q` - to close, "quit"

`:w` - to save, "write"

`:wq` - to save and then close

`:q!` - to force close, "quit", without saving, "writing"

`:u` - to "undo" your last command

`:sort` - to sort

`v` - to visually select

`d` - to "delete"

`y` - to copy, "yank"

`p` - to "past"
