## Ahoy mate!

This blog is simply a collection of snippets, notes, and current learnings. Things here might range from topics on JavaScript, React, and Sass. However, it's now turned into a Swifty blog.

### Who am I?
I'm a UX Engineer. I've been doing my thing for a little over 2 years now. As a UX Engineer, I primarily focus on front-end technologies and I get to tinker around while building high fidelity prototypes.

### How did I get to where I am now?
I attended General Assembly's WDI 3 month program.
