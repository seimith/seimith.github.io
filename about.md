## Ahoy mate!

This blog is simply a collection of snippets, thoughts, and other randomness from me. Things here might range from topics on JavaScript, React, Sass, Bash stuffs, and RV living. Do I live in an RV? No, but I really wish I did. Perhaps one day after I pay off my student loans I'll do it. However, in the meantime, I'm a stationary fool on the west coast.

### Who am I?
I'm a UX Engineer. I've been doing my thang for a little over 2 years now. As a UX Engineer, I primarily focus on front-end technologies and I get to tinker around while building high fidelity prototypes.

### How did I get to where I am now?
I attended General Assembly's WDI 3 month program.
